**Coding Style**

A consistent, clean, and tidy code makes it easier for others to read and understand your code.

Here are some common standards that should be followed through the project depending on the programming language.


*General rules:*

Spaces instead of tabs

Use descriptive variable names avoid variabile names like x, y, etc.



*HTML:*

Indent 4 spaces

1.Use lowercase element and attribute names


2.Close all HTML elements


3.Max column width characters: 100

*Javascript*

Indent 4 spaces

Prefer newer language features like lambda features when possible, they tend to make the code cleaner.

Rest of the rules can be followed from [here](https://javascript.info/coding-style)


*Python*

You should follow [Pep8 guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). 

Main takeaways are:


Use 4 spaces per indentation level.


Limit all lines to a maximum of 79 characters.


Avoid using names that are too general or too wordy. Strike a good balance between the two.

Bad: data_structure, my_list, info_map, dictionary_for_the_purpose_of_storing_data_representing_word_definitions


Good: user_profile, menu_options, word_definitions
